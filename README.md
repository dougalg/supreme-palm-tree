# supreme-palm-tree

A sample project to demonstrate the usage of Wikipedia's APIs.

## Running

Because this project uses ES6 modules, it needs to be served on a web server. Either serve the `/src` directory
using your own webserver, or for your convenience, one is provided here:

```
npm run serve
```

This will run a simple http server on port 8080, and you should be able to access it at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
```
